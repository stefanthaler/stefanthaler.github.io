title: Was my Ph.D. worth it?
tags: [science, phd, reflection]
---
About a year ago I completed my Ph.D. degree at the Technical University of Eindhoven. It took me almost five years to finish it, and one questions that I've heard many times is: "Was it worth it?". Answered from my guts I'd response - "Yes, and I'd probably do it again". In this essay, I want to explain that "Yes" in more depth. Specifically, I want to answer the questions: "What did I gain?" and "What did I pay?".

The purpose of this article is a self-reflection, and it reflects my own Ph.D. experience. I don't intend to convince anyone to do a Ph.D., nor do I believe that my self-reflections are generalizable to other Ph.D. experiences. What you gain and what you pay greatly depends on your personality, people you meet, the environment you are in, and certainly a great deal is plain (bad) luck.

# Gains
I loosely categorize my gains into four categories: knowledge, skills, character traits and the rest. Knowledge is the information and understanding I got about certain fields; Skills are the skills that I've acquired or improved; Character traits are the traits that I strengthened during my Ph.D.; and others are gains that don't fit any of the previous categories.

## Knowledge
Doing a Ph.D. allows you to collect a vast amount of knowledge. You have plenty of time to read, think try things, and meet other knowledgeable people. The knowledge that I've gained over the course of my Ph.D. can be coarsely grouped in four categories: Machine Learning, Information Security, Math and Philosophy.

**Machine Learning** During my Ph.D. I had to get time to get familiar with many machine learning techniques, in particular neural networks (or deep learning). In the beginning, I spent most of my time trying to piece together working models to solve a specific task. Later in my Ph.D., I started experimenting with custom loss functions, in particular ones that allow you to add domain knowledge to the learning process.  

**Information Security** Being surrounded by people working on different subjects in information security you gain a lot of insights about the developments in the different domains. Most of that knowledge is superficial, but you keep an overview of what is happening in the field and what problems people are working in.

**Math** During most of my Ph.D. I worked on machine learning, which relies heavily on math, in particular on Statistics, Information Theory, Probability Theory, Linear Algebra and Calculus. When you truly understand what you want to achieve with a machine learning model, you have to dive deeper in those sub fields of Mathematics. But my Ph.D. also improved my mathematical thinking in general. I improved in logical thinking and my skill to defining abstract things more precisely.

**Philosophy** A Ph.D. program is an institution that prepares you to be a scientist. A scientist's core business is to create new knowledge in a systematic way. If you want to thoroughly understand knowledge creation, you will eventually leave the domain of science and enter the domain of philosophy, in particular the [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science). The philosophy of science tries to answer questions about what is science (and what isn't), what is knowledge, how can you create it, what is the relationship between scientific knowledge and the truth and so on.

## Skills

**Understanding scientific papers** To an outsider, scientific people appear challenging to read. The language is concise, often dense and full of technical jargon that makes it difficult to read and and understand scientific people. A skill that I've learned during my Ph.D. is unpacking and understanding the dense information that is stored in such papers.

**Assessing scientific papers** Once you understand what is actually proposed in a paper, you need to be able to assess the scientific qualities of the proposed ideas. What these qualities are depend on the domain and the type of research in the paper. I've learned to look for flaws, assess the logical correctness and to find missing information, and I've learned to give an estimate of the truth of what is written.

**Dealing with scientific code** Software development in- and outside Academia are very different. Outside of Academia, you typically have a well-defined and maintained APIs and libraries which you can use to write your software. If you stumble over a bug, you can report the issue, or find a solution to your  problem in a forum such as StackOverflow. Source code in Academia is very different. It is often written by scientists that don't have a proper software engineering background. Consequently, the code somehow works, but it is written in a poor quality, often using outdated libraries or complicated setup procedures. If the code breaks, or you find a bug, most of the times you are on your own to solve it. If you are lucky you can contact the scientist that wrote the code, and with even more like you get a response in a reasonable amount of time.  

**Communicating clearly** The setting of a Ph.D. program also strongly encourages to learn how to communicate clearly. Most of the stuff you work on is abstract. Moreover, you work on your tiny obscure sub-problem, which you know a lot about but not many other people do. Since communicating your ideas to fellow scientists and other people is part of your job, I've learned to present such abstract ideas in a clearer way.

**Thinking in a structured way** Another thing that my Ph.D. helped me to improve is thinking in a more structured and systematic way. In research, most things you do are methodically. Your experiments should be reproducable, and for that you need to have some kind of protocol or method such that another person can reproduce what you have done. Also, if you have to deal with problems that no one or only a few people before have tackled, you need to systematically attack them to stand a chance of solving them. You need to identify the essential parts of the problem, see different sides of the problem and systematically try different solution attempts to progress. If you randomly throw solutions at a problem, you most likely won't stand a chance to solve it or even progress in the direction of a solution. Furthermore, if you have found a solution, you need to verify the correctness of your solution with an appropriate set of methods. All these factors contributes to a more systematic and structured thinking.  

**Writing scientific papers**

**Beating procrastination** Ph.D. positions at a University offer a significant amount of freedom on how, where and when and on what you want to work. In my case, I had to show up for the meetings I had with my supervisor and my students, but the rest was up to me. There were no fixed working hours, and nobody checked where I was and what I did. As long as I produced some output, everything was fine. The upside of this is that you get a lot of freedom on how to structure your day. But with more freedom comes more responsibility, and as soon as you start realizing your freedom, you start procrastinating. A bit of Reddit here, some chat messages there, and so on. If your deadlines are far away, and you are faced with lots of freedom, procrastination becomes a huge challenge. It took me a while to realize that, but after a while I managed to implement the habits that keep me from being distracted and work on what I should work.
