title: Was my Ph.D. worth it?
tags: [science, phd, reflection]
---
About a year ago I completed my Ph.D. degree at the Technical University of Eindhoven. It took me almost five years to finish it, and one questions that I've heard many times is: "Was it worth it?". Answered from my guts I'd response - "Yes, and I'd probably do it again". In this essay, I want to explain that "Yes" in more depth. Specifically, I want to answer the questions: "What did I gain?" and "What did I pay?".

The purpose of this article is a self-reflection, and it reflects my own Ph.D. experience. I don't intend to convince anyone to do a Ph.D., nor do I believe that my self-reflections are generalizable to other Ph.D. experiences. What you gain and what you pay greatly depends on your personality, people you meet, the environment you are in, and certainly a great deal is plain (bad) luck.

# Gains
I loosely categorize my gains into four categories: knowledge, skills, character traits and the rest. Knowledge is the information and understanding I got about certain fields; Skills are the skills that I've acquired or improved; Character traits are the traits that I strengthened during my Ph.D.; and others are gains that don't fit any of the previous categories.

## Knowledge
Doing a Ph.D. allows you to collect a vast amount of knowledge. You have plenty of time to read, think try things, and meet other knowledgeable people. The knowledge that I've gained over the course of my Ph.D. can be coarsely grouped in four categories: Machine Learning, Information Security, Math and Philosophy.

**Machine Learning**
**Information Security**

**Math** During most of my Ph.D. I worked on machine learning, which relies heavily on math, in particular on Statistics, Information Theory, Probability Theory, Linear Algebra and Calculus. When you truly understand what you want to achieve with a machine learning model, you have to dive deeper in those sub fields of Mathematics. But my Ph.D. also improved my mathematical thinking in general. I improved in logical thinking and my skill to defining abstract things more precisely.

**Philosophy** A Ph.D. program is an institution that prepares you to be a scientist. A scientist's core business is to create new knowledge in a systematic way. If you want to thoroughly understand knowledge creation, you will eventually leave the domain of science and enter the domain of philosophy, in particular the [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science). The philosophy of science tries to answer questions about what is science (and what isn't), what is knowledge, how can you create it, what is the relationship between scientific knowledge and the truth and so on.
