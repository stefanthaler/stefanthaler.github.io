# On Eating Meat
Should I eat meat? The "eating meat" topic has become quite controversial, and the question whether or not to eat meat has been bugging me for some time now. The opinions on this issues range from zealous vegans who reject eating all animal products to zealous carnivores, for whom food without meat is no food. Such extreme opinions do not really help to gain clarity on the issue. Then there is quite some fuzz about whether or not eating meat is healthy, whether or not it is good for the environment, which complicate the issue further.

In this essay I try to gain some clarity on the question whether or not to eat meat, and if I eat meat, how much. To do so, I will look at five sides of the issues that are relevant to me: the economic side - the monetary price of a meat-based diet; the environmental side - what effects does a meat-based diet have on the environment; the ethical side - whether or not it is morally wrong to eat meat; the health side - whether or not eating meat is healthy, and the pleasure side of eating meat.

I will write this essay from the point of view of a person living in a fairly affluent society with sufficient alternatives to meat available. I am aware that in other parts of the world people are starving or have more difficulties to sustain a healthy, nutritious diet, so parts of my analysis and arguments will not be valid in such a context. In a context where the alternative to not eating meat is to starve or have a poor diet, that is not a real alternative.

financials of eating meat

While researching on that topic, I've found some arguments that are not valid, and I've dedicated a section before the conclusions where I list these arguments and their rebuttal.    

# The economics of eating meat
As a rational consumer, what is the monetary price of eating meat? To answer this question, I treat the rational consumer as a person who only considers the functional aspects of food, i.e. food should keep you healthy and fulfill your needs for minerals and vitamins, and wants to do so for the smallest possible amount of money.

This definition of a rational consumer is of course a bit limiting, and my guess is that not many people shop like that. At least, people also select food that they actually like. But to me it is sufficient to discuss the price of meat.

Also, in this discussion I ignore subsidies for and externalities of meat production. Theoretically, these should be included in the discussion, but I only argue from the viewpoint of the naive customer that goes to a store to buy some food. I mention the externalities (such as damage caused by nitrites in the ground water and damage caused by global warming) in the section on the environmental aspects. I discuss the subsidies in the section politics of eating meat.

Meat in general has a reputation for proteins, iron and  B vitamins (in particular B12), and meat of fish has a reputation for Omega 3 fatty acids, which is why I focus on these nutrients and vitamins. Apart from that, liver has a lot of vitamin A.

To compare the price, I calculate

## Protein
Proteins are amino acids which perform many important functions in our body, such as building and repairing muscles.

The human body is composed of  20 different types of amino acids, most of which it can metabolize itself from other materials. There are 7 amino acids which the body cannot build by itself, so we need to get them via our food. Most foods contain a variety of these amino acids and some food types such as meat or soy beans contain all essential amino acids. Somebody who follows a somewhat varied diet will not have problems to get all essential amino acids in sufficient quantities. [Add sources, get humbers right]

The human body does not need to get all amino acids in every meal. It has a protein recycling program, that rebuilds amino acids as it needs them. For every 1 gram of ingested protein, around 5g get recycled. [Add sources, get humbers right]

According to the WHO, a typical human needs around 0.66 g protein / day / kg body weight. So an average adult weighting 70kg needs around 50 grams of proteins. To stay on the safe side, the WHO recommends 0.85g protein / day / kg body weight, which means that 98% of all people will get enough protein if they consume - on average - that amount of proteins.  These values are determined by the excess nitratres in urine, which measures the    [Add sources, get humbers right]

So how much proteins can 1 euro buy you? The cheapest that I could find was oats, followed by soy flakes. The cheapest meat I could find was minced pork meat, which would only buy you one 5th of the proteins from oats, and 1/3 of the proteins from soy flakes. So in other words, meat was around five times as expensive as the cheapest source of (incomplete) protein, and around 3 times as expensive as the cheapest source of complete protein.  

Other good sources of cheap protein seem to be some forms of dried seeds (such as flax seeds or sunflower seeds), and pretty much all forms of dried legumes such as beans, lentils or chickpeas. Most milk products were cheaper than meat.

* Oats      : 1 € buys you 153.6g (Lidl, price checked on 20. July 2020 )
* Soy flakes: 1 € buys you 95.7g (DM, price check on 20. July 2020)

* Soy flakes: 1€ buys you 750 mcg
* Oats: 1€ buys you 509.1 mcg
* Beef Liver: 1€ buys you 367.1 mcg

## Vitamin B12

Vitamin B12 is a vitamin that essential for nerves and many other metabolism related functions, and that is almost exclusively found in animal-based products such as dairy or meat. Certain fungi (yeast) and algae seem to be able to produce vitamin B12, [sources, get numbers correct]

A typical human needs around 2.4 mcg of vitamin B12 daily.

* Lamb liver: 1€ buys you 150   mcg
* Beef liver: 1€ buys you 107.6 mcg
* Mixed Mollusks: 1€ buys you 37.11 mcg
* Pork liver: 1€ buys you 28.8  mcg
* Nutritional yeast: 1€ buys you 26.3 mcg
* Milk      : 1€ buys you 6.6 mcg
* Mozzarella: 1€ buys you 4.3 mcg

* Supplements: 1€ buys you a lot

(Fish sticks)



Liver is a cheap source of vitamin B12, however, as large quantities of liver may be toxic, it is not recommended to eat it regularly. The cheapest source of non-toxic vitamin B12 is mollusks, followed by nutritional yeast, which give provide you the daily needed Vitamin B12 for only a few cents, followed by milk products, which will give you your daily dose of Vitamin B12 for around half a euro. The cheapest meat based competitor I could find is again minced meat, which is almost 10 times as expensive as mollusks or nutritional yeast.

I have included supplements, because an estimated 90% of animals are actually supplemented Vitamin B12. Unlike commonly assumed, animals do not produce B12 themselves, but get it from eating from the ground. Since most livestock does not eat from the ground anymore, it does not get vitamin B12 directly.

In conclusion, purely looking at nutrition per unit of money, meat seems to be an extensive treat. Except for liver and vitaming A and B12, meat is a lot more -- often many times more --  expensive than the non-meat based alternatives. That is before factoring in externalities such as damage done by global warming.  So if my goal were to maximize the amount of vitamins, minerals and nutrients I get per buck, then I would structure my meals around oats, spices, dried legumes, seeds, vegetables, seafood, some dairy and perhaps the occasional liver (because too much liver may actually be toxic). Of course this conclusion does not factor in taste, pleasure of eating, health, quality and other aspects of consumption.

# Health aspects of eating meat
The food we eat is closely linked to our health. Some claim that eating meat is part of a healthy diet. Others claim that eating meat is bad for your health, e.g. that you get cancer from eating meat. Although I do read scientific literature on nutrition, I will refrain from stating any opinion of myself here because I am neither a medical expert nor a dietary expert. Instead, I will summarize the advice of various national and other food authorities that are written in languages that I can understand well enough (which are German, English and Dutch).

## WHO
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet

The WHO recommendation for a healthy diet does not include meat. They basically state that a healthy diet should: " Fruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils and beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and brown rice). At least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of fruit and vegetables per day (2), excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots.". Additionally, they say to limit the intake of free sugar, salt, and of saturated fats.

They indirectly mention meats via fat. They recommend to "eating reduced-fat dairy foods and lean meats, or trimming visible fat from meat; and" and they warn from excess salt in food, e.g. "In many countries, most salt comes from processed foods (e.g. ready meals; processed meats such as bacon, ham and salami; cheese; and salty snacks)"

The WHO recommendation on saturated fats are to eat less then 10% of your calories from saturated fats. For example, if you should eat 2000 kcals a day, that means less than 200 kcals should come from saturated fats, or in other words, less than 22 grams of saturated fat. Saturated fats are found predominantly in animal-based products such as meat, dairy and butter, but it can also be found in plant based products such as nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils.

If you weren't eating any other products containing saturated fat, this recommendation meant that you could eat around 100grams of sausages a day, 120 grams of regular minced meat a day, and 300 g of lean meat a day [get numbers right, and sources correct]
If you drink two glasses of milk a day, and eat a bread with 25 grams of regular fat cheese, you should not exceed more than 20 gram of regular fat meat and not exceed 100 grams of lean meat. [TODO sources, get numbers right]

## Austrian Food Authority
Here is what the Austrian National Dietary recommendation says on meat consumption. They distinguish between fish and other meat. For Fish, they recommend to eat at least 1-2 portions (a portion being 150g) per week, preferable fatty ocean fish or cold-water fish. For meat, they recommend a maximum of 1-3 portions of lean meat per week, preferable chicken or ham. They advise you to eat red meat only occasionally.

So they advice you to eat at most (that's an upper bound) of three portions of lean meat per week.

## German Food Authority
Here is what the German Society for Nutrition (DGE) has to say about meat consumption. They say up to 300-600g lean meat and sausages per week are ok, and have 2 portion of fish per week, one of which should be fatty.

bis zu 300 – 600 g fettarmes Fleisch und fettarme Wurst und
1 Portion (80 – 150 g) Seefisch (wie Kabeljau oder Rotbarsch) und
1 Portion (70 g) fettreichen Seefisch (wie Lachs, Makrele oder Hering) und

## Swizz Food Authority
The Swizz recommend to eat meat in moderation, 2-3 portions per week are sufficient. Processed meat should be only consumed at most once per week.

Fleisch sollte massvoll konsumiert werden - im Bewusstsein, dass
2-3 Portionen Fleisch (inkl. Geflügel und Fleischerzeugnisse) pro Woche genügen. Fleischerzeugnisse wie Würste, Aufschnitt, Gepökeltes (z. B. Trockenfleisch, Schinken), Geräuchertes (z. B. Landjäger) sollten nur etwa 1-mal pro
Woche auf den Tisch kommen.

## Dutch Food Authority
The Dutch recommend not to exceed 500 grams of meat per week (including ham and sausages). Additionally, they advise you to eat less than 300g of red meat per week, with a side remark to the consequences, i.e. higher chance of colorectal cancer, diabetes and heart diseases. They also advise you to replace meat every now and then with legumes such as chickpeas, lentils or beans.

## UK

at least two portions of fish (140g, one of which should be oily)

cut down on meat, prefer lean meat. Eat a maximum of 490 grams of red or processed meat. Mix with beans, nuts and other protein sources.

## US

* A variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts,
seeds, and soy products
* The recommend around 26 oz of meat, poultry and eggs / week, if it is within.

Choices within these eating patterns may include processed meats and processed poultry as long
as the resulting eating pattern is within limits for sodium, calories from saturated fats and added sugars,
and total calories

## American Heart Association
* "Choose poultry and fish without skin and prepare them in healthy ways without added saturated and trans fat. If you choose to eat meat, look for the leanest cuts available and prepare them in healthy and delicious ways."
* Eat a variety of fish at least twice a week, especially fish containing omega-3 fatty acids (for example, salmon, trout and herring).
* Limit saturated fat and trans fat and replace them with the better fats, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. If you need to lower your blood cholesterol, reduce saturated fat to no more than 5 to 6 percent of total calories. For someone eating 2,000 calories a day, that’s about 13 grams of saturated fat.
* Limit saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, red meat, sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages. If you choose to eat red meat, compare labels and select the leanest cuts available.

## World Cancer Research Fund  / American Institute for cancer research

https://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/cancer-prevention-recommendations

350-500 lean red mead, substitute with fish, if possible. avoid processed meat. meat is not a necessary component of a healthy diet.


## Conclusion
The general gist in these recommendations for healthy nutrition seems to be: eat some meat, in particularly fish, but don't eat too much meat, in particularly avoid fatty, red and especially processed meats.

# Dismantled arguments
There are a few arguments that follow faulty reasoning.


## You need meat because it contains essential nutrients
This is simply not true. None of the essential vitamins, nutrients, and minerals are exclusively found in animal based products, and most of the plant-based alternatives are cheaper, more nutrient-dense sources. I've presented some alternatives from vitamins and nutrients that are typically associated with meat, but it easy to check for other minerals and vitamins that this is not true. It is not true for proteins (a check in nutrient database will reveal so), neither is it true for Vitamin B12, which is produced by bacteria and archaea, and can be found in untreated water and on plants if they are not washed.  

## We should eat meat because it is natural to do so
This argument typically goes along the lines: animals eat other animals, so it is natural to eat animals, which is why humans should do it.This argument is an appeal to nature, which is a logical fallacy. Just because some part of the natural world does something, or just because you can do something does not make it right, healthy or acceptable.

Arguments that follow a similar structure could be used to allow absurd consequences, which is why we should reject it. For example, animals eat grass, so it is natural to eat grass, which is why we humans should do it.  

Another arguments goes along the line: we can digest meat, so it is natural for us to eat meat, so we should do it. Again, arguments like that could allow for absurd consequences, e.g. our bodies can break down heroin, so it is natural for us to take heroin, which is why we should do it.  

## A vegan or vegetarian diet is automatically a healthy diet
It is easy to see why this is not true. One can probably survive quite some time on potato chips, pasta and tomato ketchup, and an occasional vitamin pill. This is a completely vegan diet, but it is definitely not a healthy one. There is plenty of room of messing up any diet, simply excluding one group of foods of your diet does not make your diet healthy.

## Humans have the right to eat animals because we are more intelligent than animals
Our intelligence certainly enables us to kill and eat animals, but this argument is wrong, because intelligence is no relevant criteria for deciding whether we it is right to kill another being. If that were true, this would again allow absurd consequences, namely that more intelligent people are allowed to kill and eat other, less intelligent people.

# Conclusions

From an health perspective, it seems to make sense to moderate your meat consumption, and while a little meat can be part of a healthy diet, there seems to be little evidence that it has to be. From an economic and an ecological perspective, meat is an expensive treat, both in terms of monetary and other resources, thus it would also make sense to moderate your meat consumption. From an ethical perspective, killing an animal seems to be ok in some contexts, but raising animals under horrible conditions and condemn them to a live of misery and suffering is not ok.  

Put together, my conclusion is that it makes sense to moderate ones meat consumption, and abolish the gruesome ways that animals are treated within the meat production industry.
