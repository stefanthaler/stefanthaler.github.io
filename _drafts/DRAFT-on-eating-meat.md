# On Eating Meat
Should I eat meat? The "eating meat" topic has become quite controversial, and the question whether or not to eat meat has been bugging me for some time now. The opinions on this issues range from zealous vegans who reject eating all animal products to zealous carnivores, for whom food without meat is no food. Such extreme opinions do not really help to gain clarity on the issue. Then there is quite some fuzz about whether or not eating meat is healthy, whether or not it is good for the environment, which complicate the issue further.

In this essay I try to gain some clarity on the question whether or not to eat meat, and if I eat meat, how much. To do so, I will look at five sides of the issues that are relevant to me: the economic side - the monetary price of a meat-based diet; the environmental side - what effects does a meat-based diet have on the environment; the ethical side - whether or not it is morally wrong to eat meat; the health side - whether or not eating meat is healthy, and the pleasure side of eating meat.

I will write this essay from the point of view of a person living in Western Europe, that is a fairly affluent society with sufficient alternatives to meat available. I am aware that in other parts of the world people are starving or have more difficulties to sustain a healthy, nutritious diet, so parts of my analysis and arguments will not be valid in that context.

While researching on that topic, I've found some arguments that are not valid, and I've dedicated a section before the conclusions where I list these arguments and their rebuttal.    

# The economic side of eating meat

## Iron
Heme vs non heme 5-12% ,vs 20-30%, 10-18%
50-60% of iron in meat is non-heme.

In conclusion, if my goal were purely to get the maximum of nutrition for my buck, then I would structure my meals around oats, spices, dried legumes, seeds, vegetables, mollusks, some dairy and the occasional liver (because too much liver may actually be toxic). Meat and meat products seem to be an expensive treat for the nutrition that you get. Of course this conclusion does not factor in taste, pleasure of eating, health and other aspects of the food consumed.

# Ethical side of eating meat

# Health aspects of eating meat
The food we eat is closely linked to our health. Some claim that eating meat is part of a healthy diet. Others claim that eating meat is bad for your health, e.g. that you get cancer from eating meat. Although I do read scientific literature on nutrition, I will refrain from stating any opinion of myself here because I am neither a medical expert nor a dietary expert. Instead, I will summarize the advice of various national and other food authorities that are written in languages that I can understand well enough (which are German, English and Dutch).

## WHO
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet

The WHO recommendation for a healthy diet does not include meat. They basically state that a healthy diet should: " Fruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils and beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and brown rice). At least 400 g (i.e. five portions) of fruit and vegetables per day (2), excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots.". Additionally, they say to limit the intake of free sugar, salt, and of saturated fats.

They indirectly mention meats via fat. They recommend to "eating reduced-fat dairy foods and lean meats, or trimming visible fat from meat; and" and they warn from excess salt in food, e.g. "In many countries, most salt  comes from processed foods (e.g. ready meals; processed meats such as bacon, ham and salami; cheese; and salty snacks)"

The WHO recommendation on saturated fats are to eat less then 10% of your calories from saturated fats. For example, if you should eat 2000 kcals a day, that means less than 200 kcals should come from saturated fats, or in other words, less than 22 grams.






## Austrian Food Authority
Here is what the Austrian National Dietary recommendation says on meat consumption. They distinguish between fish and other meat. For Fish, they recommend to eat at least 1-2 portions (a portion being 150g) per week, preferable fatty ocean fish or cold-water fish. For meat, they recommend a maximum of 1-3 portions of lean meat per week, preferable chicken or ham. They advise you to eat red meat only occasionally.

So they advice you to eat at most (that's an upper bound) of three portions of lean meat per week.

## German Food Authority
Here is what the German Society for Nutrition (DGE) has to say about meat consumption. They say up to 300-600g lean meat and sausages per week are ok, and have 2 portion of fish per week, one of which should be fatty.

bis zu 300 – 600 g fettarmes Fleisch und fettarme Wurst und
1 Portion (80 – 150 g) Seefisch (wie Kabeljau oder Rotbarsch) und
1 Portion (70 g) fettreichen Seefisch (wie Lachs, Makrele oder Hering) und

## Swizz Food Authority
The Swizz recommend to eat meat in moderation, 2-3  ortions per week are sufficient. Processed meat should be only consumed once per week.

Fleisch sollte massvoll konsumiert werden - im Bewusstsein, dass
2-3 Portionen Fleisch (inkl. Geflügel und Fleischerzeugnisse) pro Woche genügen. Fleischerzeugnisse wie Würste, Aufschnitt, Gepökeltes (z. B. Trockenfleisch, Schinken), Geräuchertes (z. B. Landjäger) sollten nur etwa 1-mal pro
Woche auf den Tisch kommen.

## Dutch Food Authority
The Dutch recommend not to exceed 500 grams of meat per week (including ham and sausages). Additionally, they advise you to eat less than 300g of red meat per week, with a side remark to the consequences, i.e. higher chance of colorectal cancer, diabetes and heart diseases. They also advise you to replace meat every now and then with legumes such as chickpeas, lentils or beans.

at least two portions of fish (140g, one of which should be oily)

cut down on meat, prefer lean meat. Eat a maximum of 490 grams of red or processed meat. Mix with beans, nuts and other protein sources.

## US

* A variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts,
seeds, and soy products
* The recommend around 26 oz of meat, poultry and eggs / week, if it is within.

Choices within these eating patterns may include processed meats and processed poultry as long
as the resulting eating pattern is within limits for sodium, calories from saturated fats and added sugars,
and total calories

## Canada

## American Heart Association
* "Choose poultry and fish without skin and prepare them in healthy ways without added saturated and trans fat. If you choose to eat meat, look for the leanest cuts available and prepare them in healthy and delicious ways."
* Eat a variety of fish at least twice a week, especially fish containing omega-3 fatty acids (for example, salmon, trout and herring).
* Limit saturated fat and trans fat and replace them with the better fats, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. If you need to lower your blood cholesterol, reduce saturated fat to no more than 5 to 6 percent of total calories. For someone eating 2,000 calories a day, that’s about 13 grams of saturated fat.
* Limit saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, red meat, sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages. If you choose to eat red meat, compare labels and select the leanest cuts available.
