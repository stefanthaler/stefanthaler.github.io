title: Thoughts on Critical Thinking - Facts
tags: [critical thinking, parts of thinking, society, media]

I recently watched a [Last Week Tonight segment about conspiracy theories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b_eHBZLM6U), where one of the advises was to "think critically". I paused for a moment, and asked myself what it means to "think critically". I quickly realized that while I think myself of a critical thinker, I cannot really give a succinct definition of what it means to think critical. That is why I want to explore the subject of critical thinking with a series of posts.
