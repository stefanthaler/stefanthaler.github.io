# On Eating Meat
Should I eat meat? The "eating meat" topic has become quite controversial, and the question whether or not to eat meat has been bugging me for some time now. The opinions on this issues range from zealous vegans who reject eating all animal products to zealous carnivores, for whom food without meat is no food. But many articles that I've read and opinions I've came across in discussions with friends and colleagues so far were often biased, one-sided, and one-dimensional, which don't do this topic justice.

In this essay I try to gain some clarity on the question whether or not to eat meat. To do so, I will look at five sides of the issues that are relevant to me: the economic side - the monetary price of a meat-based diet; the environmental side - what effects does a meat-based diet have on the environment; the ethical side - whether or not it is morally wrong to eat meat; the health side - whether or not eating meat is healthy, and the pleasure side of eating meat.

I will write this essay from the point of view of a person living in Western Europe, that is a fairly affluent society with sufficient alternatives to meat available. I am aware that in other parts of the world people are starving or have more difficulties to sustain a healthy, nutritious diet, so parts of my analysis and arguments will not be valid in that context.

While researching on that topic, I've found some arguments that are not valid, and I've dedicated a section before the conclusions where I list these arguments and their rebuttal.
