title: What is the value of doing a PhD?
tags: [science, phd, reflection]
---

A few months ago I completed my Ph.D. degree at the Technical University of Eindhoven. It took me almost five years to finish it, and one questions that I've heard many times from peers, friends and family is: "Was it worth it?". The answer to this question that comes straight from my guts is "Yes, and I'd do it again", but here I would like to explore the question a bit more in depth.

"Was it worth is" is a compacted question, and to properly answer it I need to unpack it to it's four core questions: "What did I gain?", "What did I have to pay for it?" and "Could I have learned them somewhere else better?".   

The purpose of this essay is self reflection of my personal experience. I am not trying to convince anybody of anything, or trying to find arguments for or against pursuing a PhD.

So, let's go down the rabbit hole...

<!-- What did I get  -->
## Gains of my PhD experience

<!-- knowledge about deep learning -->
### Machine Learning Knowledge
With regard to the current market, one of the most valuable assets that I have acquired during my PhD is solid knowledge about machine learning. At the moment, there is a huge buzz about machine learning and data science, not only in Academia but also in Industry. Slam machine learning on top of anything, and your grant money or seed funding will flow. Large parts of my research were dedicated to apply machine learning to information security problems, and by doing so I got some knowledge about machine learning, how to use it, its capabilities, its limitations, and a bit how to design some the machine learning algorithms.

### The ability to read scientific articles
These days, in most parts of the world the ability to read is often taken for granted. Nobody thinks that reading is a particularly difficult skill. However, being able to read and comprehend scientific publications is a whole different animal than being able to read a book for pleasure or a newspaper article.

Scientists often pack a lot of information in an article, and they do so in a very compact way. Additionally, they typically use the technical jargon of their respective field to describe the ideas and experiments of the article.  

Reading and understanding such material is a challenging task, as the reader needs to unpack the dense information that was packed into the article.

### The ability to assess scientific publications
Reading and understanding the main ideas of scientific articles is an important skill, but it does not help you unless you are capable of assessing the knowledge on its scientific quality. That is, you need to be able to assess threats against the validity of the presented ideas, find logical flaws, wrong or incomplete assumptions and so on. I learned that ability, but of course only within my own confined field. For example, I would have a hard time assessing a paper proposing a new cryptographic algorithm, or a paper on a new cancer drug.


<!-- learn to detect bullshit -->
With that ability to assess scientific papers, also my ability to detect bullshit increased quite a bit. This skill is not only confined to my own field of expertise, but can also be translated to other domains. You get a sense of when someone is deliberately trying to be vague, or is overusing technical jargon, or is using meaningless phrases. During my PhD I developed a good sense when someone was bullshitting, and what kind of questions to ask to cut through the mess.

<!-- Mental Resilience -->
During your PhD you are put through all kinds of stress, which helps you to train your mental resilience. One of these stresses is that you are working on a topic that you cannot really get help from anyone, because no one or not many have worked on a problem like that. As a consequence, you often try to solve problems in ways that don't work, which can be extremely frustrating. Often, you fruitlessly try to achieve something for months in row without every getting it to work. Not being able to ask anyone (or only a few)


<!-- Confidence  -->
### Confidence boost
Another benefit for me of doing my PhD was that it boosted my confidence in myself quite a bit. I remember very well how lost I felt when I started my PhD. Everything was confusing and I had a hard time reading, let alone understanding the scientific literature and scientific talks. I did not know where to start, which problem to pick or how to evaluate a problem. But, after a few years you get the hang of it, you start to bear the chaos and the unknown until you feel comfortable in the mess. And finally, finishing the PhD successfully gave me a huge boost in confidence. I now have the feeling that I can take on big, difficult tasks that take a long time to continue, because I know that if I hang in there and show up every day to work on that task that I have a fair chance to succeed.

<!-- asking questions -->

<!-- systematic approach to problems -->
<!-- the capability to remain in an unknown state on a matter -->
<!-- the capability to work on a project without instant gratification -->
<!-- communicate clearer -->
<!-- practices critical thinking -->
<!-- learned to think autonomously and independetly -->
<!-- learned to be self-motivated -->

<!-- Learning to overcome procrastination -->
When working on a PhD, sooner or later one you have to work something that you are not super motivated to work on. That is when the procrastination starts. Procrastination can come in many forms, and my guess is that almost every PhD student faces it during at one time or the other. Procrastination can mean that you check social media or news instead of working on what you are supposed to work on. Or you work on some other project that you are not supposed to work on. Or you write some important tool that will help you in all your tasks and has to be coded right now. Or you take a course

In an environment where you have to be self-motivated to achieve your goals, procrastination is one of your biggest enemies, which keeps you from doing your actual work. Ideally, after some time you learn to recognize which forms of procrastination you use to waste time, and then you learn to develop strategies on how to avoid excessive procrastination.









<!-- What did I pay for it -->
## Pains of the PhD

It is difficult to determine what I have actually payed, because you don't really know what you would have spent and gained if you had taken an alternative route in your life. I try to estimate these by my work experiences before the PhD and publicly available numbers.

### Time
Following a PhD program did not only take me five years of my life, it also took way more hours during that time. I frequently spend long hours in the office, worked from home, on the weekends and in the evenings. 50-60 hours work weeks were fairly normal, and some times, when I had teaching duties or needed to travel it could easily be more. As a consequence, my social relationships, other personal interests and my personal well-being suffered.

So compared to a normal job, the PhD cost me an extra 1-1.5 years of life-time that I would've otherwise spent differently.

### Health
Working more and being mentally more agitated than usual left its traces. I don't know how I can put a number on that, but there were many days where I felt stressed, depressed, anxious, or couldn't sleep properly. I did not suffer any mental breakdown or had a burnout, but I am fairly sure that working on my PhD reduced the quality of my life and my health.

### Money
Although you get a fairly decent salary for pursuing a PhD degree in the Netherlands, I earned less than I could have if I had worked as a software engineer. I guess I could have earned 80k-100k more in industry over the course of the five years, and that does not account for compounding effects later in life. So I strongly doubt that my PhD pays of financially.


## Could I have gotten the gains otherwise?



<!-- Was it worth it -->
## Conclusions
In conclusion, among others, during my PhD I've upgraded my critical thinking, my communication skills, and my mental stamina. I've paid for that with five years of my life, quiet a bit of money and a lot of struggle and stress. However, to me the mental skills that I have acquired and trained through that process seem to be a good bargain. Perhaps I may be wrong, but I guess that acquiring and honing those skills will make the rest of my life easier, more fulfilled and will allow me to choose more carefully what I want or don't want to do. As a martial art saying goes: train hard, fight easy. If I had the choice, I would do it again.
