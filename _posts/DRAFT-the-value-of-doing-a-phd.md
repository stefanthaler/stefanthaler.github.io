title: Was my PhD worth it?
tags: [science, phd, reflection]
---
A few months ago I completed my Ph.D. degree at the Technical University of Eindhoven. It took me almost five years to finish it, and one questions that I've heard many times is: "Was it worth it?". Answered from my guts I'd response - "Yes, and I'd do it again". But as I do not tend to solely rely on gut answers, here I would like to answer explore this answer in more depth.

The purpose of this essay is to reflect on my personal experiences. I am not trying to convince anybody of anything, or trying to find arguments for or against pursuing a PhD or not. To do so would be a folly, as PhD experiences differ a lot. What you will get from the process of obtaining the degree depends greatly on your personality and your context.  

"Was it worth is?" is a vague question that cannot be directly answered. So to properly answer it I need to find more precise questions that reflect "the worth". I came up with three questions: "What did I gain from this experience?", "What did I have to pay for it?" and "Could I have gained  somewhere else better?". The answers to these three questions form the structure of the remaining essay.

So, let's go down the rabbit hole...

<!-- What did I get  -->
## Gains of my PhD experience
First, let's start with what I think that I have got out of my PhD experience. Broadly speaking, I can separate the gains in two categories: technical skills, such as the knowledge about how to use machine learning or how to write an academic paper, and meta-skills such as the ability to remain undecided on a matter until enough evidence is in. When I started my PhD journey, I was focused more on developing the technical skills. In hindsight, I consider the meta-skill more valueable.

<!-- knowledge about deep learning -->
### Machine Learning Knowledge
With regard to the current market, one of the most valuable assets that I have acquired during my PhD is solid knowledge about machine learning, particularly deep learning. I mainly studied the application of machine learning to information security problems. That means, I looked at traditional security problems and rephrased them such that a machine learning algorithm can solve them.

As a consequence, I learned a lot about the ups and downs of using machine learning to solve your problems. Also, I had enough time to study the inner workings of some of the algorithms - an academic luxury that is rarely found in an industry setting. In the end, I was capable of designing my own algorithms, which is pretty neat. 

<!-- ability to read and assess scientific publications -->
### The ability to read scientific articles
These days, in most parts of the world the ability to read is often taken for granted. Nobody thinks that reading is a particularly difficult skill. However, being able to read and comprehend scientific publications is a whole different animal than being able to read for pleasure.

<!-- why is it difficult? -->
Scientists pack a lot of information in an article. Additionally, they describe the ideas and experiments the article using technical jargon of their respective field. Reading and understanding such material is a challenging task, because the reader needs to unpack the dense information that was packed into the article.

<!-- What is the benefit? -->
Whilst difficult, being able to read scientific articles bears some benefits and it is a requirement of doing research in the first place. It allows you to stay on top of current development your research field. Furthermore, it also allows you to form your own opinion on current developments. As such, it was a valuable trait for me to obtain.

<!-- the ability to synthesize large amounts of often conflicting information -->
After a while I not only learned to read scientific publications, but also learned to synthesize large amounts of often conflicting information. During my PhD I read a lot. On a typical day I read at least one to two papers superficially to grasp their main idea and to get an overview on a topic. To obtain the big picture view on a subject, you need to be able to place the presented ideas somewhere on this mental picture, and you need to relate it to other ideas. More often than not, you ideas conflict each other because different researchers have different views on matters, and you need to be able to keep such conflicting ideas and perspectives in your head - or at least on your notepad.

### The ability to assess scientific publications
Reading and understanding the main ideas of scientific articles is an important skill. Equally important for a scientist is the skill of assessing the presented knowledge on its scientific quality. You need to be able to assess threats against the validity of the presented ideas, find logical flaws, wrong or incomplete assumptions and so on. I learned that ability, but of course only within my own confined field. For example, I would have a hard time assessing a paper proposing a new cryptographic algorithm, or a paper on a new cancer drug.


<!-- learn to detect bullshit -->
With that ability to assess scientific papers, also my ability to detect bullshit increased quite a bit. I can also translate this bullshit-detection skill to other domains. You get a sense of when someone is deliberately trying to be vague, or is overusing technical jargon, or is using meaningless phrases. During my PhD I developed a good sense when someone was bullshitting, and what kind of questions to ask to cut through the mess.

<!-- Mental Resilience -->
### Mental Resilience
During your PhD you are put through all kinds of stress, which helps you to train your mental resilience. One of these stresses is that you are working on a topic that you cannot really get help from anyone, because no one or not many have worked on a problem like that. As a consequence, you often try to solve problems in ways that don't work, which can be extremely frustrating. Often, you fruitlessly try to achieve something for months in row without every getting it to work. Not being able to ask anyone (or only a few)

<!-- Confidence  -->
### Confidence boost
Another benefit for me of doing my PhD was that it boosted my confidence in myself quite a bit. I remember very well how lost I felt when I started my PhD. Everything was confusing and I had a hard time reading, let alone understanding the scientific literature and scientific talks. I did not know where to start, which problem to pick or how to evaluate a problem. But, after a few years you get the hang of it, you start to bear the chaos and the unknown until you feel comfortable in the mess. And finally, finishing the PhD successfully gave me a huge boost in confidence. I now have the feeling that I can take on big, difficult tasks that take a long time to continue, because I know that if I hang in there and show up every day to work on that task that I have a fair chance to succeed.

<!-- asking questions -->
### Question asking
One of the core activities in research is asking questions, and being in Academia for some time honed my skill to ask questions. At the beginning of your research career you learn that how you ask questions fundamentally shapes what you will find out. Furthermore, the quality of the questions will fundamentally determine the quality of the results - if you don't ask a good question, it is impossible to obtain a good answer.

Throughout the course of my PhD I learned a lot about asking questions. I got to know different types of questions, learned to ask meaningful  questions, learned to phrase them clearly. I learned how to ask questions that would help you to recover from a research dead-end, and I learned which questions to ask and which ones to avoid. Good questions drive good thinking, so being able to formulate them is a huge plus.

<!-- structure my thoughts -->
### Structuring my thoughts
When I started my PhD, I hated writing. I used to love writing software, but I hated writing text. To me writing text was a chore, that needs to be done because it is part of what scientists do - write papers and reports. After about one and a half years in the PhD, I kind of liked the experimenting, but I was still pretty frustrated about the writing part. That changed dramatically after I watched Simon Jones' excellent talk "[How to write a great research paper.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/)". In this talk, Simon proposes to do the writing of the paper before doing the actual experiments. It was only then that I understood that written text is  manifested thoughts. By writing, you are actually pulling out your thoughts in a compressed and orderly form out of your head and putting them down on some paper. Ideally, someone else is then capable of reading these manifested thoughts and understand a similar thing than you do.

After I got this insight what writing actually is, I started to enjoying it, because after that I realized that by becoming a better writer I would also become a better thinker, because writing enables you to think properly about what you were actually thinking. You can formulate thoughts and ideas. You can structure them. You can put them in order. You can rephrase them. All that is a lot easier when you are writing. In your head (at least in mine), all ideas seem to make perfect sense if they are in my head. As soon as I start writing the ideas down I start seeing the shortcomings of these ideas, and I can start working on improving them.

Since then, I've started to practice and improve writing actively, and as a consequence my thinking improved quite a bit. Thoughts now come in to my head in a much more orderly and clear fashion than they used to.

<!-- communicate clearer -->
### Communicate clearer
One major part of a researcher's job is to communicate your ideas clearly. These ideas are oft very abstract in nature, and more often than not fairly complex. As a consequence, one of the skills that I have acquired over time is to communicate such ideas clearer. I've learned to guess at what level of knowledge my audience was, and which concepts and what context I need to explain such that my ideas can be understood. Also, being better in writing and being better at structuring my thoughts certainly helped the communication aspect too.

<!-- Complex problem solving -->
### Problem solving skill
Many intellectual problems that I've encountered during my PhD had one thing in common: they were complex. The conscious working memory in our brain is fairly limited and can only deal with a few concepts at a time. Consequently, dealing with complex problem is challenging because they don't fit in the working memory of your brain. That's why you typically learn how to cut these problems into smaller problems, attempt to solve each sub-problem individually and then piece it back together again to get a solution for the larger problem.

<!-- systematic approach to problems -->
In addition to that, the research environment typically forces you to solve such problems in a systematic way. That is, you learn to analyze and solve these sub problems in such a way that allows other people to reproduce your solutions, and help to shed light on different facets of the problem in a structured way. Often, there are also best-practice procedures for how to address problems in a scientific way. Such best-practices depend on the research domain and the prevalent dogmas of that domain.  

<!-- the capability to remain in an unknown state on a matter -->
### Bear the unknown
Another thing that I've learned due to my time spent on research is to bear in an unknown state on a matter. Before I started doing research I loved clear-cut answers. Things were either the one or the other way, but they were definite. I thought I understood how the world works, and though I was aware that I knew little compared to human knowledge in total, I was confident about the things that I knew.

When I moved to research, that changed. The first big insight that I've got was how little I truly understand. Like, even the things I thought I knew professionally very well, I realized that I truly understood quite few of them. Next, I realized what a mess human knowledge actually is. When you grow up and you learn a lot of things, you have the feeling that all this knowledge is definite and clear cut. When you move to research at the border of understanding and knowledge, you start realizing how messy things actually are. Some researches say the one thing, some researchers say the other thing. People fight over their ideas, there is a lot of debates, controversy and difference in understanding and argument.

As soon as you move to doing your own experiments you start realizing that there are no true-cut answers to complex problems. Often, you have to admit to yourselves that you don't understand shit. Even if you manage to get some results to your experiments, you soon realize that there often more than one explanations, assumptions that need to be checked and so on.

At first, this robbed my of my confidence about knowledge in general, and I felt fairly insecure about any statement that I made. Though, after a while you realize that this inherent unknown and uncertainty is a fairly normal condition, and you start to be able to stay in an unknown state on a matter but still be confident about the shards of knowledge that you have acquired so far on that matter.

<!-- the capability to work on a project without instant gratification -->
### Work even with delayed gratification
Another thing I've learned in my time in Academia is to work on a topic without getting any gratification for the work. I often spent month doing research without getting any form of gratification. I did not make any progress, or rather I found out many ways how not to do things, nobody said thank you to me, nobody praised me for my work. Not even my monthly paycheck felt like a form of gratification, since it was only very loosely coupled to what I was doing and not doing.

This type of working felt very different than say working for a software startup like I did before. There I had I a set of chunked tasks in my sprint, and every time I completed one of the tasks I felt like I achieved something. And at the end of the day, I could point to something that I created that day. People would praise me if I did something right and thanked me if I put in some extra effort.

In Academia, I learned to stick in there even I did get nothing for the work. Even the moments when you finally get a paper accepted does not feel really that great, because it is often a long time after you did the actual work and it feels totally decoupled.

Working with delayed gratification may be important when you want to pursue long term goals. There, you often have to do some things that are not immediately rewarding but will pay off in the long term, and then it's good if you are capable of bearing the grudge.

<!-- practices critical thinking -->
### Improve critical thinking
While research, I spent a large share of my time asking questions. Good questions drive research, and finding them is often the hard part. Searching for good questions soon became a habit for me, and it was only a matter of time until I started to question my own thinking. Questioning your own thinking typically leads you to the discipline of critical thinking. Critical thinking is a type of rational thinking that follows high standards, and can be practiced.

My PhD environment offered many situations where I could practice my critical thinking skills. My supervisors greatly helped my by challenging my thinking, my peers challenged my ideas, and I often reached the borders of my knowledge and understanding.

<!-- learned to think autonomously and independetly -->
### Think independently
One skill that got boosted quite a bit by my PhD experience was my skill to think by myself. At first glance, this skill does not appear to be much of an achievement - everybody believes that they do this all the time. Of course most of thinking human beings think for themselves. But there are different degrees of independence of thought. If one reads or hears something, and then believes it without having any second thought about it one has some thinking going on, but it is not really independent. In a similar fashion, if you are only capable of thinking within the terms of common myths and dogmas of your society, you may be able to form independent thought, but within the scope that is defined by those myths and dogmas. That is more independent than the previous case, but still a fairly limited form of thinking. Once you are capable of identifying and challenging prevailing dogmas of your society, you may start forming independent thought.

Then, there is a difference between reasoning for yourselves and coming up with your own ideas, or merely compiling and reusing existing ideas that you have found somewhere in the literature or on the internet. Independence is how you came to your conclusions. If you sit in your room and write down your own thoughts on an issue, before looking up what other people were thinking on an issue.

Independent thought does not mean that you think different than the majority of society. If you think for yourselves on an issue, and the conclusion happens to be the same as the mainstream conclusion, that still means that your process of thinking was an independent one.

My PhD helped my to hone this skill, mainly for two reasons. First, I had to sit alone in my office for long periods of time where I could think on my own solutions for a problems. Being able to have the time to look for a solution greatly helps developing your skill of actually doing so. Secondly, in research some of the problems are simply not solved - there are no quick fixes or best practices to your problem on the Internet - you have to do it yourself.


<!-- learned to be self-motivated -->
### Work self-motivated
Done right, a PhD can hugely influence your capability to work self-driven. The University as an institution is among the freest in our society, not only intellectually but also on the way you work. At least in  my case, I could basically work where I wanted, when I wanted, as long as I showed up for meetings, phone conferences and my teaching duties and as long as there was some progress. Do some sports in the morning and start working after lunch - no problem. Work from home - no problem. Work in a cafe - no problem. Work one day four hours, the other twelve - do it, if it suits you. Most of the times nobody checked on me, and typically nobody cared when, where and how I did my work. Doing research at TU/e was the freest working experience I ever had.

However, that freedom comes at a price. If you don't have any external motivating factors, you need to be internally driven. Being internally motivated can be challenging if there are no checks on you. You want to watch a video on YouTube - you can do it. You want to play a game during work hours - nobody cares. But worst of all, in research, if you don't create task for yourselves, nobody else will. If you don't learn how to find a direction for your work and pursue that direction, nobody will do it for you. That is not something I was used to do. Up until my PhD, I more or less was told what to do. Not precisely every step, but roughly.

The times I worked for small companies, my tasks where shaped by the wants of my bosses and their customers. At school, we had to learn certain material to pass some tests. My University education was more of the say, only with a slightly higher degree of freedom, such as which direction to pursue and which subjects to take and which don't. In my PhD, nobody did that for my. In the PhD, I had to find my own way. Sure, it was shaped by the way Academia works, by the expertise of my supervisors and  by talks with peers in the community, but if you have to find out something that has not existed before, you have to do it yourselves. Being self-driven is a good thing to learn.

<!-- Learning to overcome procrastination -->
### Overcoming procrastination
When working on a PhD, sooner or later one you have to work something that you are not super motivated to work on - at least that was so in my case. That is when the procrastination starts. Procrastination can come in many forms, and my guess is that almost every PhD student faces it during at one time or the other. Procrastination can mean that you check social media or news instead of working on what you are supposed to work on. Or you work on some other project that you are not supposed to work on. Or you write some important tool that will help you in all your tasks and has to be coded right now. Or you take a course that is interesting, but not strictly necessary, and so on.

In an environment where you have to be self-motivated to achieve your goals, procrastination is one of your biggest enemies, which keeps you from doing your actual work. I remember that I often procrastinated for weeks in a row, until the deadline was so close that I couldn't ignore it any longer. However, after a while I realized that procrastination not only is a huge waste of time, but it also drained enormous amounts of energy from my. Thus, after a while I managed to remove almost all distractions from my work, and learned strategies to overcome my procrastination habits.

<!-- What did I pay for it -->
## Pains of the PhD

It is difficult to determine what I have actually payed, because you don't really know what you would have spent and gained if you had taken an alternative route in your life. I try to estimate these by my work experiences before the PhD and publicly available numbers.

### Time
Following a PhD program did not only take me five years of my life, it also took way more hours during that time. I frequently spend long hours in the office, worked from home, on the weekends and in the evenings. 50-60 hours work weeks were fairly normal, and some times, when I had teaching duties or needed to travel it could easily be more. As a consequence, my social relationships, other personal interests and my personal well-being suffered.

So compared to a normal job, the PhD cost me an extra 1-1.5 years of life-time that I would've otherwise spent differently.

### Health
Working more and being mentally more agitated than usual left its traces. I don't know how I can put a number on that, but there were many days where I felt stressed, depressed, anxious, or couldn't sleep properly. I did not suffer any mental breakdown or had a burnout, but I am fairly sure that working on my PhD reduced the quality of my life and my health.

### Money
Although you get a fairly decent salary for pursuing a PhD degree in the Netherlands, I earned less than I could have if I had worked as a software engineer. I guess I could have earned 80k-100k more in industry over the course of the five years, and that does not account for compounding effects later in life. So I strongly doubt that my PhD pays of financially.

## Could I have gotten the gains otherwise?

One of the final questions to ask is if I could have gotten the gains of my PhD experience in another setting, perhaps a bit cheaper. This question is difficult to answer because I think most of these skills that I've gained are not unique to a PhD. Another thing that makes it difficult to answer is that no two PhD experiences seem to be a like - the only common denominator seems to be some form of mental suffering.

I guess the best answer to that question is: yes, I could have gotten these skills somewhere else, but the environment in which I conducted my PhD as well the way my PhD program was structured greatly encouraged the development of these skills.

I also strongly doubt that I could have gotten them cheaper - in less time, or with less effort. The suffering, the feeling of being alone, the uncertainty, the doubts, and all the other crazy things in combination with a lots of time are necessary to develop these skills. I used to jokingly say that the process of doing a PhD is similar to the fermentation process. That means, a somewhat motivated person gets locked up in a room with a few juicy questions, and then is left there to rot for four or more years, until something good comes out.   

<!-- Was it worth it -->
## Conclusions
In conclusion, among others, during my PhD I've upgraded my critical thinking, my communication skills, and my mental stamina. I've paid for that with five years of my life, quiet a bit of money and a lot of struggle and stress. However, to me the mental skills that I have acquired and trained through that process seem to be a good bargain. Perhaps I may be wrong, but I guess that acquiring and honing those skills will make the rest of my life easier, more fulfilled and will allow me to choose more carefully what I want or don't want to do. As a martial art saying goes: train hard, fight easy. If I had the choice, I would do it again.
