title: Was my Ph.D. worth it?
tags: [science, phd, reflection]
---
About a year ago I completed my Ph.D. degree at the Technical University of Eindhoven. It took me almost five years to finish it, and one questions that I've heard many times is: "Was it worth it?". Answered from my guts I'd response - "Yes, and I'd probably do it again". In this essay, I want to explain that "Yes" in more depth. Specifically, I want to answer the questions: "What did I gain?" and "What did I pay?".

The purpose of this article is a self-reflection, and it reflects my own Ph.D. experience. I don't intend to convince anyone to do a Ph.D., nor do I believe that my self-reflections are generalizable to other Ph.D. experiences. What you gain and what you pay greatly depends on your personality, people you meet, the environment you are in, and certainly a great deal is plain (bad) luck.

# Gains
I loosely categorize my gains into four categories: knowledge, skills, character traits and the rest. Knowledge is the information and understanding I got about certain fields; Skills are the skills that I've acquired or improved; Character traits are the traits that I strengthened during my Ph.D.; and others are gains that don't fit any of the previous categories.
