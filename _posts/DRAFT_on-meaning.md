when is something meaningful?

nothing is inherently meaningful.

meaning is a human concept, and it is vaguely defined.

you have to take a stance, because otherwise there can be no meaning. for meaning you have to pick a context, and a point of view.

the consequences of your actions change the status quo in such a way that according to some internal measure you have contributed a most likely positive change.  

what does this definition mean for certain situation? living a simple live and praying in the morning.

what are the consequences of this definition?

pick a stance
find your internal measure
evaluate your context
find the actions that move you from your context along the internal mesasure

so, in the end of the day, you can say: i did well
