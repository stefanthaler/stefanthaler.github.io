    <h2  class="col-md-12">What We Measure Affects Our Behavior (Joseph Stiglitz).</h2>
    <div class="col-md-12">
    <ul>
      <li> If you judge the performance of a researcher by the number of publications, you will get loads of publications. Scientists are usually smart people who know how to work the system.</li>
      <li> Does it really improve the situation if individuals not are judged by these numbers, but the performance of the research institutes  instead? It definitely seems to be a good idea to put the management department in charge of these numbers. </li>
      <li> The real question is do we really want loads of publications, if only the numbers count? </li>
      <li> Lines of Code as a performance indicator for software developers was abandoned a long time ago - because what you actually want is the simplest, most readable solution with the least lines of codes that is easy to maintain </li>
    </ul>

    <h2  class="col-md-12">What are citations?</h2>
    <div class="col-md-12">
    <ul>
      <li>Citations are a tool to link pieces of knowledge together, invented long before the Internet.</li>
      <li>How can we improve citations in the era of the Internet? (make them clickable. cite paragraphs / sections. add labels to citations, e.g. used_approach, used_definition, solve_same_problem, based_on_this_solution)</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <h2  class="col-md-12">How do we track the quality of science / a researcher / a research institute?</h2>
    <div class="col-md-12">
    <ul>
      <li>That is the real questions, and it is difficult to answer, but it is for sure not related to the number of publication / citations</li>
      <li>Reproducability / Publication of Experiment protocl / Source Code / Datasets </li>
      <li>No Duplication</li>
    </ul>
