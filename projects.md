Here you find a short intro to projects I've worked on, are completed or I am currently working.

## Ongoing Projects
- [Relationship Manager](https://github.com/stefanthaler/relationship_manager). My work on IT Security and Machine Learning made me quit social media. Many of my friends, family and other people I like are spread all over Europe, and not being on social media does not really help with staying in tough with them. Hence I want to build a small web app that helps me keep track of my interactions with my friends and family so that I can keep relationships alive. The focus of this app is to help you maintain meaningful relationships, and not about maximizing advertising revenue, monetizing collected data or stealing your attention.

## Finished Projects
- [The Johnson Index](http://stefanthaler.github.io/projects/johnson_index/). The Johnson Index is a small, satiric tool that allows you to visualize and compare the accumulated citations of two researches. The project was born out of my frustration about the citation fetish that is so prevalent in current day Academia.
