Here you find a short intro to projects I've worked on, are completed or I am currently working.

## Ongoing Projects
- [Daily Reflection](https://github.com/stefanthaler/daily-reflection) Daily reflection is a small, python based command-line tool that can help conduct your daily self-reflections. You can add questions you want to ask yourself, and type in the answers, which will then be stored in a password-protected file. Daily reflection can be installed via pip (pip install daily-reflection).  

## Finished Projects
- [The Johnson Index](http://stefanthaler.github.io/projects/johnson_index/). The Johnson Index is a small, satiric tool that allows you to visualize and compare the accumulated citations of two researches. The project was born out of my frustration about the citation fetish that is so prevalent in current day Academia.
